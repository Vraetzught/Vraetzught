#👋 Hi, I’m @Vraetzught

# 👀 Do I have hobbies? Ofcourse I do!
* I love listening to all kinds of music—from the thumping bass of Hardcore, Psytrance, and EDM, to the harsh vocals and screaming guitars of Heavy Metal, and even mellow Country and Folk.
* I also love riding my motorcycle; it's my main way to get around when I'm on my own.
* This year, I started working out again, using Muay Thai to stay in shape. It's an amazing sport that challenges you both physically and mentally. But don't worry—I have no plans to compete!

🌱 I’m currently finalizing my Associate's degree in Programming and I’m excited to begin my career as a Software Developer or Web Developer.<br>
💻 My favorite language right now is C#, and I would love to specialize in .NET, preferably in Backend Development.<br>
🌐 If I had to choose a frontend framework, Angular would be my pick, although I've also learned React—I just find Angular more enjoyable.

Feel free to check out my work. I still have a lot to learn, but I’m excited and really love what I do!
