- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Vraetzught
- ðŸ‘€ My main hobbies are motorcycles and music, although I also have an interest in technology in general and I would love to pick up Muay Thai Boxing again, if I find the time.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently on a graduate course to become a programmer. I have some basic understanding of Python, HTML, CSS and JS, but I'm looking to expand my knowledge, learn new skills and learn how to use all the tools available for web- and app-developement.
