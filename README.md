* ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Vraetzught
* ðŸ‘€ Do I have hobbies? Ofcourse I do!
  * I love listening to various different kinds of music, from the thumpÃ®ng bass in Hardcore, Psytrance or EDM, to the harsh vocals and screaming guitars in Heavy Metal, to mellow Country and folk music and everything in between.
  * I also love rising my motorcycle, in fact it is my main way to get anywhere when I'm alone.
  * This year I also started working out again, using Muay Thai to stay in shape. It's a wonderfull sport that challenges you both physically and mentaly, but don't worry, I have no ambition to actually fight competitively. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently finalizing my Associates degree in Programming and I'm looking foreward to my first real job as either a software developer or web developer. My favourite language at this time is C# and I would love to specialise in .NET, prefferably backend, but if I have to choose a frontend framework, I would choose Angular. I've also learned to work with React, but I find I like Angular a lot more.

Feel free to take a look at my work. I still have a lot to learn, but I'm exited and found I really like doing this.
